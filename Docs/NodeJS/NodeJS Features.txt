Features of Node.js
Following is a list of some important features of Node.js that makes it the first choice of software architects.

--Extremely fast: Node.js is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, so its library is very fast in code execution.

--I/O is Asynchronous and Event Driven: All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous i.e. non-blocking. So a Node.js 
based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a 
notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call. 
It is also a reason that it is very fast.

--Single threaded: Node.js follows a single threaded model with event looping.

--Highly Scalable: Node.js is highly scalable because event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way.

--No buffering: Node.js cuts down the overall processing time while uploading audio and video files. Node.js 
applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.

--Open source: Node.js has an open source community which has produced many excellent modules to add additional 
capabilities to Node.js applications.

--License: Node.js is released under the MIT license.
